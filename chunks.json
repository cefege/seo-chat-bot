What influence do these constraints have upon the future of mobile search? Studying Query Suggestions on Phones In many cases, the future of the Web is on smaller screens, which presents challenges not only from a design stance, but also from how search engines may suggest queries and present results to searchers.

Search engines are also paying more attention to the smaller screens, and the more limited keyboards available to people who access the Web by phone.  What influence do these constraints have upon the future of mobile search? Studying Query Suggestions on Phones In many cases, the future of the Web is on smaller screens, which presents challenges not only from a design stance, but also from how search engines may suggest queries and present results to searchers.

Some Phone Search Usage Patterns Some interesting observations came from the study: Mobile phone users will rely heavily on suggestions if they are provided. People asked to search on a system which provided query suggestions considered their workload lighter, their enjoyment higher, and saved half the keystokes than searchers who didn\u2019t use a system offering query suggestions. Users tend to select the correct suggestion by the third time that it is shown. Users will accept suggestions even if it means an increase in the total number of key presses (scrolling down to select a suggestion instead of typing the rest of the word out on their keyboards).

Converse  US Patent Application 20080168053  Published July 10, 2008  Filed January 10, 2007 Abstract A method and apparatus for improving search results is provided. The method works by delineating sections of a document that are not relevant to the main content. The document content is subjected to ranking analysis in entirety.

The method works by delineating sections of a document that are not relevant to the main content. The document content is subjected to ranking analysis in entirety. In response to a query results are recalled omitting terms included in the no-recall sections. Terms in the no-recall sections are not used in titles and abstracts of the results.

Building a solid technical foundation for a site, where search engine spiders don\u2019t run into problems crawling and indexing pages is a necessity if site owners want their pages and content found at all. One of the things that I think we can take away from this patent filing is that search engines may purposefully decide not to index some parts of pages, or provide less weight to those parts. If nothing else, that tells us that if you are going to put something on a page, and you think that it is important to the topic covered by that page, it\u2019s worth considering including that information in the main content area than in some place like the footer to the page.

Google and Bing definitely do have different ranking algorithms in place.  Many of the things that you do to rank well in one of those will help with the other as well, but not everything. As for ranking well with news articles, there are somewhat different algorithms in place as well, that can value things like whether or not a story is topical \u2013 suddenly drawing the interest of lots of people as a current event, and backed with a sudden increase in interest and searches.

Google pointed out that about anchor text relevance in one of the earliest white papers about how the search engine works: This idea of propagating anchor text to the page it refers to was implemented in the World Wide Web Worm [McBryan 94] especially because it helps search non-text information and expands the search coverage with fewer downloaded documents. We use anchor propagation mostly because anchor text can help provide better quality results. Using anchor text efficiently is technically difficult because of the large amounts of data that must be processed.

A recently published patent application from Microsoft describes how they might weigh anchor text relevance of links differently based upon relationships between pages where those links are found, or where they might be pointed towards. Many Google patents also describe ways that they might weigh anchor text relevance differently. The Microsoft patent filing points out some examples of when one or more links pointing to a page might not carry as much anchor text weight as you might assume it would. The first example is when you have one or more mirror sites of a particular site. When links and their related anchor text point from those mirror sites to another site, it isn\u2019t beneficial from a search engine ranking perspective to count those links and their anchor text more than once.

When reading through this Microsoft patent application, I was reminded very much of a Google patent that I wrote about last year in my post,  Google\u2019s Affiliated Page Link Patent , in which Google described how they might attempt to gauge how related sites that linked to each other might appear to be while they determined how much weight to pass along from one page to another.

Google\u2019s Phrase-Based Indexing Patents also provide different weights associated with anchor text based upon several different factors, as noted in the following passage from the first of those patents,  Phrase-based indexing in an information retrieval system : A given document d in the document collection may have some number of outlinks to other documents.

That is, each link in the document collection has a pair of scores, an outlink score, and an inlink score. * * My Emphasis The patent goes on to explain how the phrase-based indexing approach might impact anchor weights differently, by whether or not it is a \u201cgood phrase,\u201d whether or not it intentionally appears within the document being pointed towards, and whether or not it is a \u201crelated\u201d phrase under the definition defined by that patent.

The Microsoft patent filing doesn\u2019t cover the different types of instances described in those different Google patents. Still, it does try to understand the relationships between sites that point to the same page using the same anchor text and the relationship between pages that link to another page. In the instance of multiple pages using the same anchor text, and linking to the same page, the two or more pages linking to that page might be examined to see if they tend to link to many the same pages or similar pages. If there\u2019s a large amount of overlap, the weight of the anchor text from those pages might be reduced. When looking at a single page pointing a link to a page on another site, the level of \u201cdependence\u201d the destination page has upon the linking page might be explored.

Anchor Text Relevance Conclusion How much anchor text relevance weight from a link provided to a page\u2019s ranking in search results? It may depend upon several factors, including how related or affiliated the search engines might think the sites doing the linking are to the site being linked to are, how related or affiliated sites linking to the destination page might be, how related the text or phrase in the link might be to the page being linked to might be, and possibly some \u201creasonable surfer\u201d type features associated with the link.","chunk":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.seobythesea.com\/2011\/10\/how-a-search-engine-might-weigh-the-relevance-of-anchor-text-differently\/"}

I\u2019ve seen the question raised in many places about how much weight, either PageRank or hypertext relevance, might be passed along to a page when there are two or more links on the same page to another page. A search engine might collapse those links together and treat them as a single link, or it might derive different weights for them based upon reasonable surfer type features and then possibly discount their total value. It\u2019s also possible that the anchor text relevancy of those links could depend upon how related the text within the links might be to the page being pointed towards. There may be other issues involved and how might relevant anchor text might pass along to another page. Still, the Microsoft and Google patent filings provide some interesting starting points in exploring that topic. Last Updated June 9, 2019.

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 11:48 am    Hi larsoze, It\u2019s really hard to perform the kinds of tests that you describe, and truly measure the value of the things that you implement. Anchor text pointed to pages should ideally help the page being linked to rank higher for the terms used, but there are a lot of potential variables in how much weight they may pass along, which is what this Microsoft patent describes.  Chances are that linking using both exact phrases and related phrases as well might provide even more benefits in the right circumstances. The difficulty sometimes is understanding those circumstances. \ud83d\ude42   Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at","chunk":16,"url":"https:\/\/www.seobythesea.com\/2011\/10\/how-a-search-engine-might-weigh-the-relevance-of-anchor-text-differently\/"}

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 12:19 pm    Hi William, The patents that I\u2019ve pointed to in my post definitely target that kind of behavior, and we know that the search engines are spending at least some of their time and energy coming up with new ways to identify link exchanges and cooperative arrangements.  They do try to identify approaches that can impact as many sites as possible with as few false positives as they can. As I\u2019ve mentioned in at least one comment above, in many cases the kind of cooperative linking they are concerned about are reasonable and legitimate links, such as a publisher who has a number of somewhat related sites that link to each other. The focus isn\u2019t on stopping those types of links as much as it is in not giving them too much credit, so that they become more valuable than","chunk":21,"url":"https:\/\/www.seobythesea.com\/2011\/10\/how-a-search-engine-might-weigh-the-relevance-of-anchor-text-differently\/"}

Akash Kumar      10\/04\/2011 at 11:11 pm    So does that mean that search engines are now not dependent on the anchor text only for the evaluation of links and the relevancy of that link? I mean what could be the other possible factors the search engines could be looking for while analyzing a link? As far as I can think is that search engines value the text on the page of the link and near it.

What we don\u2019t see in this patent is that the search engine might look at other things related to those two sites as well.

Google pointed out that about anchor text relevance in one of the earliest white papers about how the search engine works: This idea of propagating anchor text to the page it refers to was implemented in the World Wide Web Worm [McBryan 94] especially because it helps search non-text information and expands the search coverage with fewer downloaded documents. We use anchor propagation mostly because anchor text can help provide better quality results. Using anchor text efficiently is technically difficult because of the large amounts of data that must be processed. In our current crawl of 24 million pages, we had over 259 million anchors, which we indexed. \u2013  The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine But one of the assumptions that many make is that each link, with its anchor text, is equally as important as any other link and that if a page has lots of links pointing","chunk":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.seobythesea.com\/2011\/10\/how-a-search-engine-might-weigh-the-relevance-of-anchor-text-differently\/"}

A recently published patent application from Microsoft describes how they might weigh anchor text relevance of links differently based upon relationships between pages where those links are found, or where they might be pointed towards. Many Google patents also describe ways that they might weigh anchor text relevance differently. The Microsoft patent filing points out some examples of when one or more links pointing to a page might not carry as much anchor text weight as you might assume it would. The first example is when you have one or more mirror sites of a particular site. When links and their related anchor text point from those mirror sites to another site, it isn\u2019t beneficial from a search engine ranking perspective to count those links and their anchor text more than once.

When reading through this Microsoft patent application, I was reminded very much of a Google patent that I wrote about last year in my post,  Google\u2019s Affiliated Page Link Patent , in which Google described how they might attempt to gauge how related sites that linked to each other might appear to be while they determined how much weight to pass along from one page to another.

Google\u2019s Phrase-Based Indexing Patents also provide different weights associated with anchor text based upon several different factors, as noted in the following passage from the first of those patents,  Phrase-based indexing in an information retrieval system : A given document d in the document collection may have some number of outlinks to other documents.

That is, each link in the document collection has a pair of scores, an outlink score, and an inlink score. * * My Emphasis The patent goes on to explain how the phrase-based indexing approach might impact anchor weights differently, by whether or not it is a \u201cgood phrase,\u201d whether or not it intentionally appears within the document being pointed towards, and whether or not it is a \u201crelated\u201d phrase under the definition defined by that patent.

The Microsoft patent filing doesn\u2019t cover the different types of instances described in those different Google patents. Still, it does try to understand the relationships between sites that point to the same page using the same anchor text and the relationship between pages that link to another page. In the instance of multiple pages using the same anchor text, and linking to the same page, the two or more pages linking to that page might be examined to see if they tend to link to many the same pages or similar pages. If there\u2019s a large amount of overlap, the weight of the anchor text from those pages might be reduced. When looking at a single page pointing a link to a page on another site, the level of \u201cdependence\u201d the destination page has upon the linking page might be explored.

Anchor Text Relevance Conclusion How much anchor text relevance weight from a link provided to a page\u2019s ranking in search results? It may depend upon several factors, including how related or affiliated the search engines might think the sites doing the linking are to the site being linked to are, how related or affiliated sites linking to the destination page might be, how related the text or phrase in the link might be to the page being linked to might be, and possibly some \u201creasonable surfer\u201d type features associated with the link.","chunk":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.seobythesea.com\/2011\/10\/how-a-search-engine-might-weigh-the-relevance-of-anchor-text-differently\/"}

I\u2019ve seen the question raised in many places about how much weight, either PageRank or hypertext relevance, might be passed along to a page when there are two or more links on the same page to another page. A search engine might collapse those links together and treat them as a single link, or it might derive different weights for them based upon reasonable surfer type features and then possibly discount their total value. It\u2019s also possible that the anchor text relevancy of those links could depend upon how related the text within the links might be to the page being pointed towards. There may be other issues involved and how might relevant anchor text might pass along to another page. Still, the Microsoft and Google patent filings provide some interesting starting points in exploring that topic. Last Updated June 9, 2019.

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 11:48 am    Hi larsoze, It\u2019s really hard to perform the kinds of tests that you describe, and truly measure the value of the things that you implement. Anchor text pointed to pages should ideally help the page being linked to rank higher for the terms used, but there are a lot of potential variables in how much weight they may pass along, which is what this Microsoft patent describes.  Chances are that linking using both exact phrases and related phrases as well might provide even more benefits in the right circumstances. The difficulty sometimes is understanding those circumstances. \ud83d\ude42   Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at","chunk":16,"url":"https:\/\/www.seobythesea.com\/2011\/10\/how-a-search-engine-might-weigh-the-relevance-of-anchor-text-differently\/"}

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 12:07 pm    Hi Patrick, Lessening the amount of hypertext relevance between sites that might be related in some way in this patent seems to be mostly (but not completely) aimed at a search engine not giving too much benefit or credit for anchor text and links that might be reasonable, such as a collection of news media sites from the same publisher pointing at each other, or some mirror sites that might link to the same pages. It\u2019s possible that Google may try a few different approaches to get a sense of whether certain sites are affiliated in some manner.

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 12:10 pm    Hi Ewan, It is possible that an approach like this might be able to identify blog networks created for linking purposes based upon their shared links to other sites.  When it comes to trying to prevent that kind of behavior, the search engines often aim at making it harder for individuals to manipulate search results by creating much more work for them. Good points on how multiple signals might be telling when they are looked at together. The mind does boggle.

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 12:19 pm    Hi William, The patents that I\u2019ve pointed to in my post definitely target that kind of behavior, and we know that the search engines are spending at least some of their time and energy coming up with new ways to identify link exchanges and cooperative arrangements.  They do try to identify approaches that can impact as many sites as possible with as few false positives as they can. As I\u2019ve mentioned in at least one comment above, in many cases the kind of cooperative linking they are concerned about are reasonable and legitimate links, such as a publisher who has a number of somewhat related sites that link to each other.

Bill Slawski      10\/10\/2011 at 11:16 am    Hi John, I like to try to use related text in the anchor text I use when I link as well, but sometimes when you\u2019re linking the best place to do so in your content might not always involve the most descriptive text. Though I do have to say that it can be really difficult in many instances to understand how much weight or relevance your link might impart to the page that you\u2019re pointing towards.  I\u2019ve seen some instances where I know that there\u2019s a single link to a page using specific anchor text and it has made a difference, but often there are so many other things going on that it\u2019s hard to tell.

Many Google patents also describe ways that they might weigh anchor text relevance differently. The Microsoft patent filing points out some examples of when one or more links pointing to a page might not carry as much anchor text weight as you might assume it would. The first example is when you have one or more mirror sites of a particular site.

I\u2019ve seen the question raised in many places about how much weight, either PageRank or hypertext relevance, might be passed along to a page when there are two or more links on the same page to another page. A search engine might collapse those links together and treat them as a single link, or it might derive different weights for them based upon reasonable surfer type features and then possibly discount their total value. It\u2019s also possible that the anchor text relevancy of those links could depend upon how related the text within the links might be to the page being pointed towards. There may be other issues involved and how might relevant anchor text might pass along to another page.

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 11:48 am    Hi larsoze, It\u2019s really hard to perform the kinds of tests that you describe, and truly measure the value of the things that you implement. Anchor text pointed to pages should ideally help the page being linked to rank higher for the terms used, but there are a lot of potential variables in how much weight they may pass along, which is what this Microsoft patent describes.  Chances are that linking using both exact phrases and related phrases as well might provide even more benefits in the right circumstances. The difficulty sometimes is understanding those circumstances. \ud83d\ude42   Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at","chunk":16,"url":"https:\/\/www.seobythesea.com\/2011\/10\/how-a-search-engine-might-weigh-the-relevance-of-anchor-text-differently\/"}

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 12:07 pm    Hi Patrick, Lessening the amount of hypertext relevance between sites that might be related in some way in this patent seems to be mostly (but not completely) aimed at a search engine not giving too much benefit or credit for anchor text and links that might be reasonable, such as a collection of news media sites from the same publisher pointing at each other, or some mirror sites that might link to the same pages.

Bill Slawski      10\/04\/2011 at 12:10 pm    Hi Ewan, It is possible that an approach like this might be able to identify blog networks created for linking purposes based upon their shared links to other sites.

John Mondt      10\/09\/2011 at 3:08 pm    Great read Bill, I have always been curious to test this out as much as I can. Over my time building links, I have never noticed a difference in the rankings when I use non-related anchor text. Obviously I still use the related anchor text because I am a firm believer that you can drive numerous amounts of traffic by having related anchor text. Some people spend too much time on back links and never really utilize the traffic coming to those sites that they have linked to as well. Might as well kill two birds with one stone, right?

Bill Slawski      10\/10\/2011 at 10:45 am    Hi Akash, Titles for pages seem to be one of the more important signals that search engines may look at, though unfortunately there are sites where the site owners don\u2019t use titles for pages that are very descriptive of the content on the pages being titled.

Bill Slawski      10\/10\/2011 at 10:57 am    Hi Brian, I think an awareness of how search engines might weigh and measure the anchor text if finds pointing to your pages can be helpful in a number of ways, and I think looking at these patents can give us an idea of how search engineers might feel about anchor text. We know that they still value it very much, but they are trying to learn how to use it better as a ranking signal, and how to reign it in in some circumstances, or avoid situations where it might be manipulated or abused.

I do like to follow and recommend a linkbuilding approach of providing what I think might be useful and engaging enough information that people might find interesting enough to talk about, link to, and refer others to. I do know that the words I use within the title to blog posts, and in the content I create might influence the anchor text that people might use to point to a specific page or post. I\u2019m not advocating that one shouldn\u2019t acquire links from other sites, but rather stating that it can often be easier to acquire those links if you do things like help solve other people\u2019s problems, or give them something interesting that they might want to share, or present them with a resource that they can build upon.

I appreciate your visits, and discussion here. I think it\u2019s healthy to question some of the patents that I write about \u2013 it might take an army to implement some of the things that they point towards, but I do think we\u2019re better off knowing about them, and thinking critically about what they might imply.

In that case,the anchor text from those two site might not count as highly. What we don\u2019t see in this patent is that the search engine might look at other things related to those two sites as well. For example, they might be mirror sites, in which case the search engine might decide to index one of them, and not the other because they would be providing substantially duplicate content. This patent focuses pretty much upon how much weight to give anchor text from the sites, and it\u2019s focus is pretty narrow, but the kinds of things that you mention may also be things that the search engine is doing as well.

Transparency is always preferable to obfuscation and would serve everybody well here and in Maps. Mike   ajjutrendy      12\/11\/2008 at 12:37 am    Hi  Google has often told us that the information that they collect about us is used to provide us with a better user experience, and the information that they provide.

And, at the  Google Privacy Policy Page , they even tell us the following: We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Google services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. That is in reference to information that you provide when you sign up for a Google Account, and provide Google with information through that account. One issue here though is that they are sharing information about searchers with third party content partners that may be paying for the ability to use that information, and to appear above the search results for a query. If these \u201ccontent partners\u201d are paying to provide that information, could that prominent placement be considered advertising?  If so, should it be disclosed to searchers that there is a business relationship between those content providers and the search engine?

It does worry me how much information google collects. I read this morning on Searchcap that even disabling to Google Toolbar won\u2019t stop them from tracking what you do. Kinda worrying to know there is very little you can do about your search habits thanks to the client server internet model.   Bill Slawski      01\/27\/2010 at 10:48 pm    Hi Mat, I saw the article that you mention, and I\u2019ve been following Ben Edelman\u2019s site for a few years now, since his research on the Great Firewall of China.  His article on the topic is worth reading: Google Toolbar Tracks Browsing Even After Users Choose \u201cDisable\u201d . Comments are closed.
